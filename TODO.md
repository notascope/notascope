- makefile
- paths in the makefile, except for virtualenv (`parso`)
- for each script, save off a PNG
  - `/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --headless --screenshot="/Users/nicolas/Downloads/test.png" "https://google.com/"` for the JS-based ones?
- for each pair, save the filter output to a file
- then run one script that combines all the output files into one csv
- save off html
- make a mini app that lets you see the diff and the cost function and the output
